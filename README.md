# ESP-NOW-Car-Control-Project

Welcome to the **ESP32 ESP-NOW Car Control System**!  
This project allows you to control your robotic car in two exciting modes:
- üéÆ **Manual Mode** ‚Äî drive the car yourself using a Joystick over ESP-NOW wireless communication.
- ü§ñ **Autonomous Mode** ‚Äî let the car drive itself and intelligently avoid obstacles!

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. Manual Mode (Joystick Control)

- **Transmitter ESP32** reads joystick input (forward, backward, left, right).
- It sends control commands wirelessly over **ESP-NOW** to the **Receiver ESP32** on the car.
- **Receiver ESP32** drives the motors based on the received direction.

### 2. Autonomous Mode (Obstacle Avoidance)

- The **Receiver ESP32** uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances.
- If an obstacle is detected in front, the car automatically turns left or right to avoid collision.
- No joystick needed ‚Äî fully autonomous operation.

## üì° ESP-NOW Communication Flow

[Transmitter ESP32 (Joystick)] ‚á© ESP-NOW Wireless Signal ‚á© [Receiver ESP32 (Car)] ‚á® Motor Driver ‚á® Motors

- ESP-NOW is a **fast, connectionless protocol** perfect for low-latency robotic projects.
- No WiFi Router required!

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Find ESP32 MAC Address
- Upload `mac_address_finder.ino` to your **Receiver ESP32**.
- Open Serial Monitor at 115200 baud rate.
- Copy the printed MAC Address ‚Äî you will use it inside the `transmitter_joystick.ino` to send data to correct receiver.

### Step 2: Manual Joystick Car Mode
1. Upload `transmitter_joystick.ino` to your **Transmitter ESP32** (connected to Joystick).
2. Upload `receiver_manual_car.ino` to your **Receiver ESP32** (on the car).
3. Power both boards.
4. Control your car manually with the Joystick!

### Step 3: Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance Mode
1. Upload `receiver_autonomous_obstacle_car.ino` to your **Receiver ESP32**.
2. No need for transmitter board.
3. The car will automatically start detecting and avoiding obstacles!
